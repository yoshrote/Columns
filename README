Columns
================================================================================================

Columns is a publishing platform with an HTML, JSON and ATOM interface.
The goal is to be a blogging platform that behaves very sociably.
The XML and JSON interfaces can be used as the backbone for a provisioning API to be used with 
external sites and applications.
3rd party authentication is supported by default.

This platform is intended to be capable of communicating to other instances of itself it can be 
used as a client or a server application.  This could create a social networking hub application 
run client-side by grabbing.  Part of the plan is to implement the server-side of Pubsubhubbub
and integrate that into the platform.

Development Features
================================================================================================

Columns aims to be a generic Atompub compliant server complete with:

- HTML admin interface
- HTML, JSON and ATOM formatted XML interfaces are all supported automatically (XML still needs work)
- Input validation
- a very flexible authorization framework capable of any range of complex security policies
- OpenID and OAuth support for 3rd party authentication with the ability to easy 
  add in any other kind of authentication method desired

Adding new atom entry types and categories is very easy.  Under typical use
the AtompubController class can be used to quickly create a controller for resources.
